The purpose of this repo is to make an Agent that can expose the following tools:

- sync_transactions
- get_balance

It should be able to manage auth using secure practices. 
It writes its data to text files for development, but Postgresql for prod. 

RULES:

- Write good tests, and lots of them. We're dealing with people's money here. 
- Use Python best practices and modern tooling
- Store data securely or not at all
- Follow Plaid API spec and mind any breaking changes
- Look for examples in the space and see if you can use it for inspiration. 

Good luck, we're all counting on you!
